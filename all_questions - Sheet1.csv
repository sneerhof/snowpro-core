354,What aspect of an executed query is represented by the remote disk I/O statistic of the Query Profile in Snowflake?,D,Time spent reading and writing data from and to remote storage when the data being accessed does not fit into the executing virtual warehouse node memory,Time spent scanning the table partitions to filter data based on the predicate,Time spent caching the data to remote storage in order to buffer the data being extracted and exported,Time spent reading and writing data from and to remote storage when the data being accessed does not fit into either the virtual warehouse memory or the local disk,,,"For some operations (e.g. duplicate elimination for a huge data set), the amount of memory available for the compute resources used to execute the operation might not be sufficient to hold intermediate results. As a result, the query processing engine will start spilling the data to local disk. If the local disk space is not sufficient, the spilled data is then saved to remote disks.

This spilling can have a profound effect on query performance (especially if remote disk is used for spilling). Performance degrades drastically when a warehouse runs out of memory while executing a query because memory bytes must “spill” onto local disk storage. If the query requires even more memory, it spills onto remote cloud-provider storage, which results in even worse performance.

Remote Disk I/O is the metric of the Query profile which can analyze the time spent reading/writing data from/it remote storage (i.e. S3 or Azure Blob storage). This would include things like spilling to remote disk, or reading your datasets.",https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-query-profile,
